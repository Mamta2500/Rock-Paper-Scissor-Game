# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

A well-known illustration of a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web game is the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. By clicking on the appropriate buttons, players choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer chooses its move at random. The game's rules state that rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock to determine who will win. JavaScript is used to manage user interactions and game logic, while HTML and CSS are used for layout and styling in the game interface design.
